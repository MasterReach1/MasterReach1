# Hi! I'm Ethan Cox, a caffeinated developer.

Let's get the credentials out of the way... I'm a *self-taught* developer that obtained an **AAS degree** in Computer Information Systems with a focus on Programming. Mouthful, I know.

I love my front-end projects because I have a knack for design and a genuine interest in making web applications with a smooth UI/UX. Despite loving front-end, I have back-end proficiencies as well... 

I suppose that makes me full stack!

In all aspects of life, I love coffee. It basically flows through my veins at this point.

From what I hear, some form of caffeine is necessary if you're going to code... So here I am!

When not chilling around the house or coding, I'll play disk golf, read, play guitar, joyride, take trips to the beach (yeah I'm close to the infamous Florida, home of the Florida man himself), and hang with friends and family.
