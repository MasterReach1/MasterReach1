- 👋 Hi, my name is Ethan Cox.
- 👀 I’m interested in mobile app and web development as well as Application Security (AppSec)!
- 🌱 I'm currently learning Git and Haskell; I never can truly stop learning my programming languages in this ever-growing age of information.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any mobile, open-source, or security/privacy-based development projects.
- 📫 I can be reached at mrxone2025@protonmail.com (preferred method of contact)
